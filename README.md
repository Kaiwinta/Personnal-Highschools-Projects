# Personnal-Highschools-Projects

Some projects and ideas I made before entering Epitech.

These are example projects I worked on in my early teens (around 15). The repository contains small, self-contained experiments and utilities — each folder is a standalone project. I didn't know much about GitHub at the time, so the commits and structure are informal.

Projects
--------

- `1-Wishlist` — A small Tkinter application for creating and managing wishlists. It stores items (name, price, link) in text files so you can save, reopen, and update wishlists between launches. I built it to organize links and components for building a PC.

- `2-Youtube-Downloader` — A simple tool (also made in 2023) that attempted to download YouTube videos by URL. The Tkinter interface and the packaging attempt with `cx_Freeze` were the highlights. The downloader no longer works reliably, but the UI and packaging experiments are kept for reference.

- `3-Database` — Personal/educational sandbox for interacting with a local SQLite database. Includes helper functions and small example scripts to explore basic CRUD operations and simple data extraction from the provided sample DB (`user.sqbpro`).

- `4-Pytorch-test` — Experiments with PyTorch and related concepts: tensors, autograd, backpropagation, and simple models (linear/logistic regression). Useful as quick learning examples and small demos.

- `5-SAP-copycat` — A work-in-progress project inspired by SAP-like workflows to manage orders, packages and products. The goal is a lightweight interface and database structure to track orders and inventory for small factories. Includes notes on database separation (orders vs product data), class structure, and operational constraints.

Notes
-----

- These projects were created as learning exercises and are provided as-is for reference and personal archival.
- File and code quality varies — expect some experimental code and minimal documentation in places.
- If you'd like, I can help tidy up a specific project, add tests, or prepare a proper packaging/setup for any of them.
